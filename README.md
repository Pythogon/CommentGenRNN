# CommentGenRNN
A comment generator utilising textgenrnn.    
    
## Instructions    
FOR PYTHON 3.6.x ONLY    
Run `installer.py`       
If you don't have it already, install Git at https://git-scm.com/.    
Use `git clone https://github.com/Pythogon/CommentGenRNN.git` in a directory of your choice.    
Replace `comments.txt` with some text you would like the neural network to replicate (recommended: 12,000 lines+)    
Run `ai.py`. From personal experience this only works in the IDLE, so run from the IDLE (right click, hover over 'edit with IDLE' and click IDLE 3.6, then once it boots hit `F5`).
